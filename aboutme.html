            My name is Benjamin Roque and I'm a student from Lakeland, Florida. I'm a half West Indian and half Filipino first generation child to my lovely parents. I grew up with two older sisters and two beautiful dogs. One things that's stayed with me throughout my life is my love of anything art. When I got to middle school I really dove into this interest taking art classes up through my senior year. I took AP 2-D Studio Design and AP Drawing my junior and senior year, scoring a 5 and 4 on my porfolios. These classes helped me build a passion for art that also told me I shouldn't go to medical school like my parents wanted me to.<br>

            This is where I began researching graphic design. I had taken an InDesign course many moons ago in my freshman year, but despite not remembering much about the program, I remembered enjoying it, especially the lessons about layout and color use. As a student in the Polk State digital media program, I want to develop a skilset that allows me to focus on things like layout and color, but also a wider variety of skills that allow me to communicate a clients needs effectively. Outside of my life as an aspiring designer, I <em>love</em> coffee and chai! I have  a part time job, and I love music!

        <h2>Some Extra Bits..</h2><br>
        <p>It often goes unnoticed by people who don't look into this field of work what it actually takes to do what we do. Because of this, people question why designers charge what they do. When it comes to pricing, there are many reasons why designers are payed the way they are. Ranging from the job being asked, to the experience of the designer and even the technology being used, the details can become more complex than you might imagine. If you're interested in some of the things I use to achieve my goals as a student, look below!</p><br>

    </div>



    <div class="gallery">
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/camera_image.jpg" alt="camera image"><p>Cameras have given me the ability to not only capture my subject, but also capture elements for my design like textures. </p></div> 
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/mac_image.jpg" alt="laptop image"><p>Because going to the lab on campus isn't always an option for me, having a macbook has saved me in more ways than one!</p></div>
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/harddrive_image.jpg" alt="harddrive image"><p>A hard drive has been so important for my workflow as a student at Polk State. It has also helped protect my workflow by operating as one backup. </p></div>
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/creative_cloud.jpg" alt="image od adobe creative cloud"><p>Of course nothing would get done without the Adobe Creative Cloud. This is where the work gets done!</p></div>
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/time_image.jpg" alt="clock image"><p>Time management is easily the biggest part of being not just a designer but a student as well.</p></div>
        <div class="images"><img src="image_galleryimages/cafe_image.jpg" alt="image of a cafe"><p>My brain is fueled by coffee and bakery foods. I'd probably be failing at everything wiithout them.</p></div>
